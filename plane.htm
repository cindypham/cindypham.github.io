                    <h2><i>Helping dreams take flight</i></h2>
                    
                    <line></line>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Client</h3>
                    <p>Aerospace Museum of California</p>
                    
                    <line></line>
                    
                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>The Aerospace Museum of California is an aviation museum that features displays of authentic military and civilian aircraft as well as space vehicle replicas. With its main audience comprising of children 6-12 years old, the museum is developing a program to encourage and educate youth with digital/online learning experiences as supplements to their displays.</p>
                    
                    <p>I created a mobile site that focused on one of the museum's displays, the Pitts Special aerobatic biplanes. The QR code for the site is placed in front of the display so that museum visitors can scan the code with their phone and interact with the site.</p>
                    
                     <line></line>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>I brainstormed how to convey information to children that would be an educational experience while keeping them engaged. Rather than having a site that listed facts, I played around with the idea of portraying the creator of the planes, Curtis Pitts, as a cartoon character who would talk directly to the audience. Going along with the cartoon aesthetic, I decided to format the site like a storybook that viewers could tap or click between the pages. By having an approachable and fun aesthetic alongside realistic images of the planes, I wanted to create a site that was educational yet interactive and charming to its audience.</p>
                    
                    <p>For the color palette I selected bright red and blue colors that would imitate the iconic Pitts plane designs. I also wanted to use a font that was reminscent of cloud lettering. While the images of the planes would change on each page, I also tweaked the expression of Pitts's character to make him more dynamic and animated to the audience as he explains why his plane is so special.</p>

                    
                     <line></line>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>The final mobile site consists of 6 bright and colorful pages in a storybook format, where the character Curtis Pitts communicates with the audience about why his plane is special. He introduces the concept of aerobatic biplanes, as well as the design and development of his planes, while maintaining a friendly and easygoing tone to keep the audience engaged. The site is viewable on desktop, tablet, and mobile, with easy navigation through the clickable left and right buttons.</p>
                    
                    <p>The graphics were designed in Illustrator and Photoshop and the site was coded in HTML and CSS in less than 24 hours for the Aerospace Museum. With more time, I would like to animate all the pages with Javascript to look even more appealing for children.</p>
