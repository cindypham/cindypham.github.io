                    <p>Tina is a young and bright entrepreneur who set up her own online store to sell handcrafted accessories geared towards women. When she saw the competitive market on Etsy, she knew that she needed a strong branding identity to stand out among other boutiques and market her products. Starting from complete scratch, she asked me to help transform her brand in a way that would unite her store's girlish aesthetic and homemade philosophy while keeping a refined, professional look to still be taken seriously.</p>
                 
                    

                    
                     <line></line>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Process</h3>

					<div class="large-6 columns">

	<p>To create a branding identity for La Fleur, I developed a full package of business cards, stationery, website, and promotional posters. These were all materials necessary for the boutique's marketing and packaging.</p>

	<p>The concept for La Fleur's branding revolved around flower crowns, which is the store's primary and most popular asset. I wanted to emanate the soft, elegant aesthetic of Tina's flower crowns while emphasizing the personalized, handcrafted quality of her products. To showcase these aspects of the brand, I played around with pastel colors, baby pinks, and baby blues, as well as experimented different handwriting and lettering styles. I also collaborated with Tina to do a photoshoot, in which I took pictures and edited promotional images for the boutique. These were all things that I felt would not only accurately represent her brand, but also garner attention and interest by engaging with her target audience.</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p><img src="img/lafleur_cards.png"></p>
                    <p>I cultivated a full branding identity package for La Fleur Boutique in which I selected the colors, fonts, and styles for business cards, stationery, website, and promotional posters. In order to make her store more unique, I decided to create circular business cards instead of the standard rectangle shape to mimic the circular shape of the wreath in her flower crowns. To reflect the soft and delicate products, I chose light pink and other pastel colors, which are extremely prevalent in the brand's stationery set and promotional posters. I also used chalk lettering to emanate the boutique owner's personalized touch. It was important to convey a light, airy feeling with the girlish aesthetic of her products. With a complete and cohesive identity, La Fleur Boutique can have a confident brand that's both inviting and alluring.</p>
