                    <line></line>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Client</h3>
                    <p>Professor Susan Verba</p>
                    
                    <line></line>
                    
                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>The redesigned PG&E utility bill is a concept that was conceived for an information design course at UC Davis. I was prompted to reimagine the energy utility bill to communicate energy use experientially with user-centered research, secondary research, and user-testing. The main priority was to create a visual display of energy use and cost information that would help people make sense of their energy use behaviors.</p>
                
                    
                     <line></line>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>On the existing utility bill, there is no way to tell where energy usage comes from, and the only way to analyze energy consumption patterns is through the monthly billing history chart; that is, if the consumer even cares enough to stop and analyze it. It is also difficiult to determine where your eye should travel due to equal weight in visual hierarchy and lots of text dump. I wanted to combat these weaknesses in my redesign by making it more intuitive to customers and encourage them to be energy efficient.</p>
                    
                    <p>In my interviews with users, a common trend was that the first thing people would look at was the total cost of their bill; therefore, the primary goal of a utility bill should convey clearly and quickly how much the user is paying their bill this month. I also foun that users glanced at their monthly billing history because it is the only visual cue on their bill, but take little time analyzing it and would only put in the effort to do so if there was a large spike. Energy consciousness was mixed among respondents, because people were either apathetic about energy usage and only cared about how much money they were paying, or they were mindful about saving energy but had little information to go by.</p>
                    
                    <p>With the feedback in mind, my concept for a reimagined utility bill was a one-page, clean, and concise energy statement that relies heavily on visual cues and creates a visual hierarchy. Total charge would be the biggest element on the bill because that was user's #1 priority. I wanted to capture customers' attention to their energy usage even if they were apathetic about energy conservation. The best way to do so was to connect it to where their money was coming from. I decided I would break down the different costs into a pie chart so customers could notice if they were spending an absurd amount of money on something. The new design would not only make them aware, but also care.</p>

                    
                     <line></line>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>My concept for the new utility bill creates a clear visual hierarchy while showing causality between money-spending and energy consumption. I did this by integrating images and numbers together with icons and percentages, as well as meaningful color choices by utilizing different shades of PG&E's blue and yellow colors. After conducting user testings with my proposed utility bill, the consensus among all users was that it was a huge improvement from the original bill because it was extremely straightforward and clear. Users preferred having a one-page electric bill that contained the most important information, and any further details (such as yearly usage) was preferred to be accessed online for the sake of not disrupting the simplicity of the proposed bill.</p>
                    
                    <p>The area that generated the most mixed responses from users was the neighborhood ranking. People liked the idea but wondered how ranking worked in rpoportion to household number, and thought the thumbs up/thumbs down sticker seemed arbitrary. If I had omre time to work on this project, my first priority would be improving the ranking section of the utility bill by being more transparent on how the ranking system worked. Rather than directly compare neighbors in the userâ€™s proximity, I would compare the user to neighbors in 100 homes of similar size that used the same heating fuel. Their ranking would be calculated out of 100 and assigned a letter grade (for example, top 20 would receive an A). This would level out the competition and hopefully give more incentive for users to believe they have a fair chance of rising up their ranking.
                    
                    </p>
